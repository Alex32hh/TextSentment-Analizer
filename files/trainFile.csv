0,How Phoenix Feeds The Hungry With Fresh Food While Saving Local Businesses and Farms,www.irishtimes.com,"Around the world, individuals have found all kinds of innovative ways to support each other during the coronavirus pandemic—but so have governments. In Arizona, the city of Phoenix has managed to save dozens of farms and restaurants, while also getting free meals to those who need it most.

Between July and December in 2020, the Feed Phoenix program provided more than 50,000 meals to local residents—an amazing feat in itself, but only the beginning.

When the city received its CARES Act federal funding in April, it could have simply directed the money to food banks. Instead, it asked a nonprofit group, Local First Arizona, to take a more holistic approach to shore up the city’s food system.

The resulting Feed Phoenix program has been a success on all fronts, connecting struggling farmers with restaurants and caterers in need of business. The nonprofit buys produce directly from the farms, then pays the restaurants to prepare and deliver free meals to citizens in need.",1,,,,,,,,

4,Gal Gadot says she cried watching ‘Wonder Woman 1984’,www.nme.com,"Gal Gadot has admitted that she cried while watching Wonder Woman 1984 for the very first time.• Read more: Wonder Woman 1984 review: a smart and stylish superhero sequel with lots of heartSpeaking in a new interview, the actor, who plays Diana Prince and her titular alter ego in the DC movie, said she was so engrossed in it that she didn’t even think about her own involvement.“I can’t tell you about the moment in the movie that made me cry other than it happens at the very beginning,” Gadot told Hello! (via msn). “I’ve never experienced that before. I was watching and all of a sudden I wasn’t the actress, the producer, or anything on set.”She continued: “I was a little girl from a suburb in Israel watching this amazing character doing such incredible things. And I’m not an easy crier. I’m not the kind of woman who watches commercials and cries.“I just had such a strong reaction to this movie and it caught me off guard. Usually I save my crying for special occasions… like when I’m pregnant!”Gadot also talked about how proud she is of her Wonder Woman character and how it’s proven to be inspirational for so many people.“It’s something I wasn’t really prepared for, so to see and hear the reaction from women, men, boys and girls, is just incredible,” she said.She added: “There was one little boy I will always remember. He saw the movie and told his mother, ‘When I grow up, I want to be a woman’.“It was all because of ‘Wonder Woman’ and everything she stands for and symbolises.”Last month, Gadot opened up about her “own experience” which “wasn’t the best one” with Joss Whedon on the set of Justice League.The Wonder Woman star has spoken out following an investigation launched by WarnerMedia into the set, after comments made by her co-star on the DC film, Ray Fisher.“I’m happy for Ray to go out and speak his truth,” Gadot told the Los Angeles Times. “I wasn’t there with the guys when they shot with Joss Whedon — I had my own experience with [him], which wasn’t the best one, but I took care of it there and when it happened.”Meanwhile, Wonder Woman 3 has been confirmed and will be fast-tracked by Warner Bros, the studio has announced.",2,,,,,,,,
5,"CES 2021 trends to look for in TV streaming, fitness apps, video chat software and more",www.cnet.com,"CES 2021 will be a different tech show during a very different year. Most of us have had to forgo everything from movie theaters to gyms to bars in favor of streaming services, fitness apps and video chat platforms -- giving software and services a place closer to the top of the tech innovation pyramid. That evolution will be on display at the virtual conference.While no one will be walking the Las Vegas floors trying out new products that promise to consolidate your TV streaming, use your brain waves to dispel anxiety and improve your sleep, the apps and services that have been the center of our entertainment, exercise and work and social lives will play a big role at this year's CES, often taking advantage of the virtual environment that they operate in naturally.Here are a few services, apps and software trends we expect to see at CES 2021.Read more: The top 6 trends to expect at CES 2021Streaming services grapple with the closure of movie theatersThough there will be far fewer major media companies present at CES 2021, we'll likely get a glimpse at how some of the pivots from movies to streaming services are faring, as CNET's Joan Solsman reported. The head of Warner Bros. will take part in a keynote called Entertainment Transformed, and will likely discuss the company's plans to release all of its new movies this year for streaming on HBO Max the same day they hit theaters, starting with last month's Wonder Woman 1984.Other CES panels will include executives from Amazon, Starz, Pluto TV and more discussing the massive increase in streaming service subscriptions since the start of pandemic lockdowns last March.Though we aren't expecting announcements from major players like Netflix or Hulu, it's likely that 2021 will continue the surge in streaming service subscriptions, especially as more shows and movies change hands or premiere. The arrival of The Office on NBC's Peacock likely boosted subscriptions this month, for example, as Wonder Woman 1984 did for HBO Max.The pandemic brings home entertainment, video chat equipment to the forefrontWith many parts of the world dealing with surges in coronavirus cases and lots of people still working and entertaining themselves from home, home entertainment vendors will have tons of new TVs, soundbars and streaming devices on display at CES 2021.We've already gotten a glimpse of new Sony TVs that boast massive, brighter OLED screens and run the new Google TV streaming system. Samsung will also have a ton of new home entertainment products to show off, including huge MicroLED TVs that let you watch four shows at once, QLED TVs that come in 4K and 8K resolution and soundbars with subwoofer microphones to upgrade your home theater experience.On the video chat side, we'll see a number of vendors looking to improve your experience on Zoom, Microsoft Teams or your service of choice, for work or for socializing. Companies like Owl Labs, j5create and Labpano will show off 360-degree cameras and related software, while Crew in a Box claims to offer a professional-quality plug-and-play remote video production solution.It remains to be seen whether any of these will catch on as widely as popular smart home tools like the Amazon Echo Show, Google Nest and Facebook Portal, which all support Zoom and other video chat platforms now. But many people will continue working from home until a COVID-19 vaccine is widely available, these products will likely garner some interest.As the pandemic closed or limited use of many gyms and fitness classes starting in March, at-home fitness products, apps and services saw major growth. At CES, we expect to see several new offerings in this category. Ultrahuman, a new health and fitness app debuting at the show, uses a MasterClass-like strategy helping people meditate, workout and optimize sleep with the help of athletes, neuroscientists, artists and psychologists. Wearable company Amazfit is unveiling its new Amazfit HomeStudio, a connected treadmill and fitness class hub.Samsung TVs are even getting in on the fitness action: A new feature on the electronics giant's 2021 televisions called Smart Trainer lets you attach a webcam to your TV so the Samsung Health app can track your workout progress and offer coaching and encouragement.With people investing large chunks of money in at-home gym equipment and the apps and services that come with them (looking at you, Peloton), it'll be interesting to see if, when gyms are totally safe to return to, people flock back or stay in their at-home fitness studios. The fitness tech we see at CES could be a further sign of the move away from working out in gyms and into living rooms.The information contained in this article is for educational and informational purposes only and is not intended as health or medical advice.
