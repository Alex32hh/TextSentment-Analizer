0,The good news hidden within one of America’s darkest weeks,www.washingtonpost.com,"The Wall Street Journal’s editorial page, the guardian of American conservatism, consistently ridiculed worries about Trump’s autocratic tendencies. A year into his presidency, it opined that his tenure “must be terribly disappointing to the progressive elites who a year ago predicted an authoritarian America because Mr. Trump posed a unique threat to democratic norms.” It claimed that all Trump could really be accused of was “excessive” rhetorical attacks on the media. Senior Republicans refused to even make such tepid objections. Some, such as Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.), quickly morphed into sycophants, eager to encourage his worst impulses.After the pandemic began, many conservatives pointed out that Trump did not use the crisis to expand executive power, which proved that he has no authoritarian tendencies whatsoever. But this is a profound misunderstanding of authoritarianism. Abraham Lincoln and Franklin D. Roosevelt both used souped-up authority to save the nation from dire emergencies. That did not make them tyrants. An autocrat seeks power for himself, to strengthen his own hold on the office and destroy his enemies. Vladimir Putin accumulated power not so he could provide social security to Russians but to ensure that no one could ever challenge him.After the 2020 elections, most Republican leaders remained silent as Trump spread cancerous lies and conspiracy theories. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.), the second-most-important Republican, refused to acknowledge that President-elect Joe Biden had won the election for weeks and declared that Trump was “100 percent within his rights” to mount all his court challenges. But the fact that one can use certain legal mechanisms does not mean that one should. Norms are as important as laws. The erosion of democracy in other countries — from Hungary to Turkey to India — has taken place, for the most part, through entirely legal means.That senators such as Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), both well-trained constitutional experts, have used the law to subvert democracy is the best example that smarts and education do not ensure that a person will act with honor and decency. Keep in mind that just hours after the attempted insurrection on Capitol Hill, they, along with six other Republican senators and 139 members of the House, voted to support the demands of those insurrectionists.So why, after all this, do I see some hidden good news? First, the insurrection ultimately failed. Order was restored, and within hours the results of the November election were certified. Biden will be inaugurated on Jan. 20. In fact, this week’s chaos has put the rebels on the defensive — most prominently the leader of the insurrection, Trump, who, two months after the election, finally pledged an orderly transition. It has also finally led some Republicans, including McConnell and Vice President Pence, to stop coddling Trump. Perhaps they have come to recognize that tax cuts and judges are not worth the shredding of democracy. And don’t forget that voters in Georgia rejected Trumpism this week, electing two Democrats to the Senate and granting Biden a governing mandate.For four years, I have wondered when the Trump fever would break. When, I wondered, would people see that he was not a comical figure, enjoying his bizarre reality television version of the presidency, but a narcissist and a demagogue, stoking racism and hate, deeply at odds with the democratic character of the country? This week, it might have happened. You don’t need the whole country to snap away — even by the time Richard M. Nixon resigned, a quarter of Americans still supported him — but you need enough that it resets the norm. Perhaps we had to go over the edge to climb back.When I was growing up far away from the United States in the 1970s, I found myself following events there with intense interest. Those years were filled with turmoil. The United States suffered its first major military defeat, the president resigned in disgrace, and the Soviet Union was poised to take advantage of its rival superpower’s weakness. Yet despite it all, I still felt a deep attraction to America. The chaos and disruption were evidence of an open society in the midst of great change, a place that showcased all the anger and turmoil that come with wrenching dislocations and transformations. But these things were also the sign of a country airing its problems and facing its challenges; a place that, having weathered the storm, would find new resilience, energy and strength. I believe that today as well.",0

2,"Amazon to drop Parler from its web hosting service, citing violent posts",www.cnbc.com,"Amazon has pulled the plug on Parler, a social media app popular with Trump supporters, in the wake of the deadly U.S. Capitol riot earlier this week.Amazon's cloud-computing unit, Amazon Web Services (AWS), informed Parler on Saturday that it will no longer provide cloud services to the company beginning on Sunday at 11:59 p.m. PT, according to an email obtained by CNBC. AWS provides cloud services to Parler that host its website, which means that if Parler can't locate a new cloud provider by Sunday night, the site will go offline for its users.News of Amazon's decision to drop Parler was first reported by BuzzFeed. Multiple news outlets reported that Amazon had already suspended Parler, but the site was still available to CNBC staff as of the early morning hours East Coast time.In the email, Amazon Web Services' Trust and Safety team told Parler's Chief Policy Officer Amy Peikoff that the platform continues to host ""violent content"" that violates AWS' terms of service. AWS said it wasn't satisfied with Parler's attempts to moderate content on its platform and, as a result, would move to ""suspend Parler's account.""""AWS provides technology and services to customers across the political spectrum, and we continue to respect Parler's right to determine for itself what content it will allow on its site,"" the letter states. ""However, we cannot provide services to a customer that is unable to effectively identify and remove content that encourages or incites violence against others. Because Parler cannot comply with our terms of service and poses a very real risk to public safety, we plan to suspend Parler's account effective Sunday, January 10th, at 11:59PM PST.""Although Google and Apple both removed the Parler app from their app stores on Friday and Saturday, respectively, users could still log in if they already had the app installed or through the Parler website. Amazon's move to stop hosting Parler goes a step further, effectively taking it completely offline unless the company can find a new host first.An Amazon spokesperson confirmed the authenticity of the letter to CNBC, but declined to comment further. A Parler spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.AWS told Parler in the email that it had flagged 98 examples to Parler of posts that ""clearly encourage and incite violence."" Among the posts it reported to Parler, which were viewed by CNBC, users on the platform made violent threats directed at ""liberal leaders, liberal activists #blm leaders and supporters,"" in addition to other groups.Screenshots of the Parler app viewed by CNBC show users posting references to firing squads, as well as calls to bring weapons to the presidential inauguration later this month.John Matze, Parler's CEO, told the New York Times' Kara Swisher in an interview on Thursday that he didn't ""feel responsible for any of this and neither should the platform, considering we're a neutral town square that just adheres to the law.""Parler, which launched in 2018, has emerged as a popular platform for President Trump's allies in the last year by billing itself as a free speech alternative to mainstream social media services like Twitter and Facebook.Earlier on Saturday, a group of Amazon employees had called on the company to cut ties with Parler. In a tweet late Saturday, the group, Amazon Employees for Climate Justice, applauded the company's decision to drop Parler.",2
3,Vaccine News Boosts Colorado Business Leaders’ Optimism,www.usnews.com,"The attempts to dress up their actions as part of a coherent and deliberate decision-making structure were trying to mask an uncomfortable truth about our most important speech forums: Platforms can and will do what they like. This week a small handful of extremely powerful tech executives slowly tiptoed toward the edge, egging one another on, being pushed by commentators and employees, until they agreed to hold hands and jump. This was a display of awesome power, not an acknowledgment of culpability. These were more editorial and business decisions taken under fire than the neutral application of prior guidelines. A tiny group of people in Silicon Valley are defining modern discourse, ostensibly establishing a Twilight Zone where the rules are something between democratic governance and journalism, but they’re doing it on the fly in ways that suit them.In two weeks, Trump will be out of power, but platforms won’t be. They should be forced to live up to the sentiments in their fig-leaf rationales.Platforms tied themselves in knots this week trying to tell the first story and make their actions seem consistent with the idea that they were simply making a neutral call based on their existing policies. In one sense, they’re right to say their actions were consistent with the rules they’ve always had. A good argument can be made—indeed, I have made it in The Atlantic—that democracy requires voters to know who their candidates really are and what they believe, even (or, perhaps, especially) when those beliefs are abhorrent. So platforms have long treated the president differently from other users on the grounds that what he says is inherently newsworthy and in the public interest for people to know about even if it violates their rules.But every platform left a “break glass” escape in the case of incitement to violence. Speech always has to be evaluated in context, and the context this week could not be ignored. The president incited insurrection at the U.S. Capitol resulting in at least five deaths, and it’s possible more violence is yet to come. For Mark Zuckerberg, Trump’s use of Facebook to condone, rather than condemn, the riots led Zuckerberg to believe the risks of continuing to allow the president to post were too high. The decision wasn’t clear-cut, but “on balance,” another Facebook executive said, the president was deemed to be contributing to, rather than diminishing, the threat of ongoing violence. The company engaged in a careful and principled balancing test, considering all relevant factors.Facebook’s decision backed Twitter into a corner. Twitter had originally locked Trump’s account for 12 hours, even as calls for the company to ban him entirely grew louder. When the president got his handle back, he shot off some fairly anodyne tweets celebrating his supporters and announcing that he wouldn’t be attending Joe Biden’s inauguration, posts that seemed entirely within the typical Trump genre. Not so, said Twitter in a long and detailed blog post announcing the account’s permanent suspension. The context of these tweets and “specifically how they are being received and interpreted on and off Twitter” meant that they amounted to a glorification of violence. Twitter’s rules have penumbras, apparently, and Trump’s dog whistles to his followers now fall within them.",2
4,"In Capitol Riot, Communications Between Agencies Hampered Forceful Response",www.wsj.com,"Wednesday, Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy got the first of several calls from Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser. Trump supporters were breaching the Capitol, overwhelming police officers, and Ms. Bowser wanted D.C. National Guard soldiers for reinforcement.Pentagon officials asked for clarification, saying they needed a request based on capabilities rather than number of forces, defense officials said. “What do you want to do with them?” one U.S. official asked. “There was a determined sense of urgency but not a sense of panic. We wanted to get these guys moving.”About 90 minutes passed sorting out those needs, with Mr. McCarthy approving the redeployment of 200 troops already at traffic checkpoints and subway stations in the city. More time went by before the soldiers retrieved protective gear and arrived at the Capitol.In those hours, the mob rioted through the halls and offices of Congress, in the first siege of the building by American citizens. Five people died, including a woman shot by police as she climbed through a smashed door pane outside the House chamber and a police officer fatally injured after being struck in the head with a fire extinguisher.As rioters stormed the Capitol, the numerous federal and local agencies that police the nation’s capital produced a flood of urgent communications, but they struggled to sort through lines of command and coordinate a forceful response to the assault spiraling beyond their control.",1
5,Trump allies warn him not to run in 2024,www.politico.com,"A growing number of Republicans hold Trump for inciting the deadly riots inside the U.S. Capitol Wednesday. The clashes came hours after they Trump for a pair of losses in Georgia that will leave the Senate in Democratic control.In interviews, more than half a dozen Republicans who had supported or worked for Trump say the president isn’t likely to run again, though he may tease it. If Trump changes his mind again and chooses to run, some said they would urge him not to, while others hope he’d be talked out of it.“I think nothing is going to happen,” said a Trump friend. “He won’t be around in 2024. He’s not going to run. He’s going to fuck around and say he’s going to run. … He’ll tease. I don’t think he’s ever going to say ‘I won’t run.’ He just won’t run.""With less than two weeks left in his term, Democrats are for Trump’s removal from office, state officials are pressing for criminal charges, allies are dropping their support, and aides and even cabinet officials are abandoning him. His crusade to overturn his clear-cut electoral loss has left the Republican Party — already divided during the Trump presidency — embroiled in a civil war.“The Republican Party is more divided now than it was two months ago, which is not how it’s supposed to work,” said Republican strategist Alex Conant, who worked for two presidential candidates. “If anything we should be more united now as we get ready to serve as the opposition.”Those new fractures began when Trump started about rigged elections last spring as he anticipated electoral defeat and plotted a strategy to hang onto power. He after his loss alleging fraud with scant evidence, pressuring state leaders to overturn the election, threatening Republicans who disobeyed him, and criticizing his ever-loyal vice president Mike Pence.“The four years of substantial policy accomplishments, whether it be the economy, judges, the Supreme Court, all of that is wiped away by six weeks of extraordinary undisciplined bad behavior that culminated in a day of disgrace at the United States Capitol,” said a national Republican strategist who worked to elect the president.Whit Ayres, a longtime Republican pollster, described Congress’ certification of the election results on Wednesday as the “opening round of what will be a fight for the soul of the Republican Party.”Talk of Trump’s conduct prompting a GOP civil war has happened before. But never has it come at a time when the president’s political stature has been so damaged. The party’s base may still be with him. But his capacity to reach them — and, in doing so, intimidate others — took a serious hit on Friday when the major social media platforms either suspended his account indefinitely or kicked him off entirely.Some Republicans — including those who had defended Trump through controversy after controversy for four chaotic years — had thought with near certainty that Trump would be their standard bearer after he left office, even though he never had much allegiance to the GOP. Not anymore.“He is not the leader of any Republican Party I recognize,” said Scott Jennings, who worked for President George W. Bush and is close to the Trump White House.A former Trump aide said the president now “needs to be ostracized and excommunicated from the Republican Party.”Still, more than 100 House Republicans and a dozen Senate Republicans had signed onto objecting to the certification of Joe Biden’s victory. They don’t blame him for what happened at the Capitol. Nor do some party stalwarts.“All the people who despise and dislike Donald Trump have looked for every possible reason to smear him,” said former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a Trump ally, who argued that the media was partially to blame for the “outpouring of frustration and rage” by those who rioted. ""Biden will be the de facto president. But for 45 percent of the country, he will never be an acceptable president. There will always be a belief this was a corrupt and dishonest election.""Even those who have turned on Trump know he remains popular with his conservative base, many of whom he brought into the party. Trump received more than 74 million votes in the November election, the second highest number ever next to Biden’s 81 million.“The problem for the GOP is that every Republican on Capitol Hill needs the support of these protesters — and people like them — for survival,” a senior Trump adviser said. “Unless and until the party can find a message that is more popular with the white working class than Donald Trump, there is no bright future for Republicans.”Mounting a second act would be difficult for Trump even if he weren’t surrounded by controversy and suspended from his social media accounts. Most recent former presidents have shied away from the limelight after leaving office, in part to allow their successor to govern.Several presidents have tried to secure a second non-consecutive term, but Grover Cleveland is the only one to succeed, mounting a 1892 comeback after being voted out of office in 1888.Trump allies say the president hasn’t decided what he will do after he leaves the White House. But he has told them he wants to hold rallies and campaign against Republican candidates who didn’t support his bid to overturn the election, including Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia.But presidential historians say Trump may find that he fades from political relevance after leaving office, the way former presidents Jimmy Carter and George H.W. Bush did.And Trump’s thirst for the political spotlight may fade as well—even if his desire for attention doesn’t. The president’s allies say he had cooled to formally announcing his candidacy for 2024 because running again would require that he disclose financial information, according to two Republicans close to Trump. Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and top aide, and Bill Stepien, Trump’s 2020 campaign manager, had advised him to take his time.The Trump Organization is to have lost millions of dollars during the coronavirus outbreak, just before Trump has to pay back $421 million in loans that he guaranteed, much of it to foreign creditors, according to a New York Times of Trump’s personal and business tax returns. Meanwhile, New York investigators are examining whether Trump improperly inflated assets, evaded taxes, and paid off women alleging affairs in violation of campaign finance laws.With such legal drama awaiting him, Trump is expected to keep teasing a presidential run — without actually filing the paperwork or erecting a campaign — to garner the attention he seeks.“He may not ultimately pull the trigger,” said a former Trump aide who remains close to the White House.If Trump makes declarative statements about running, purchases campaign ads, or spends more than $5,000 on an actual campaign, he would have to register as a candidate for office. But if he just explores a potential candidacy, he doesn’t have to, so long as he spends less than the legal maximum on things like polling, travel and calls to potential supporters, according to the and election lawyers.“He’s going to hold it out there long enough for him to be a player,” a former senior administration official said, “and then try to be a powerbroker.”",1
